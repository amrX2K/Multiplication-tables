Multiplication-tables
=====================

This is a simple Python script that I created for quizzing the user on the multiplication tables. It was written at a Manchester Raspberry Jam meeting, with the idea coming from a young boy who wished to help his sister learn her times tables. Manchester Raspberry Jam is a meeting for users of the Raspberry Pi device and meets on the second Saturday of each month at Madlab in Manchester (www.twitter.com/mcrraspjam)
